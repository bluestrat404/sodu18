							<h1>Connect</h1>
							<p>It's hard to get to know a church through a website. We invite you to come worship with us, attend a Q &amp; A, and sign up for our New Member Class, which is offered on Sunday afternoons throughout the year.</p>

<h3>Attend a Q &amp; A</h3>
<p>Immediately following the service on the first Sunday of the month, one of our elders holds a twenty-minute question and answer session in the auditorium. These are open to the public and to any question about Christianity, the Bible, or our church. We don't promise to have the answer to every question, but we do promise honest answers to honest questions, as best as we can.</p>
<p>At the end of each Q &amp; A, we give a three-minute presentation about the mission and vision of South Durham Church for those who want to learn more. Elders are available afterwards for more questions and conversation.<p>

							<h3>Visit a Community Group</h3>
<p>Community Groups are smaller gatherings of our church that meet in homes throughout the week. This is a great way to get to know us in a deeper way. Use the button below to find a group and let the leader know you're coming. When you visit, you can expect to be welcomed by friendly people, enjoy a light snack or meal depending on the group, and participate in a Bible study and prayer. We would love to see you at this week's meeting.</p>

							<h3>Come to a New Member Class</h3>
<p>The first step to joining our church family is to attend a New Member Class, where you’ll enjoy discovering the history, mission, and vision of South Durham Church, meet some of our leaders, and learn about what it means to be a church member. The New Member Class is held throughout the year over the course of two Sunday afternoons.</p>

<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<h4>We exist to make disciples of Jesus Christ to the glory of God through God-centered worship, gospel-driven discipleship, and grace-filled mission.</h4>
<p>This is the mission that Jesus calls his followers to in the Bible:</p>
<blockquote>“Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.” —Jesus, Matthew 28:18–20</blockquote>
<p>Jesus gave this command to his followers right before he ascended into heaven. Today, the church carries out this mission though the gathering of believers in worship, teaching, obedience to Christ, and sharing the good news about him with others.</p>
<p>We believe in:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>God-Centered Worship</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>As Creator, King, Judge, and Savior, God is sovereign, holy, and worthy of worship. Therefore, our worship centers on God &mdash; who He is and what He has done &mdash; rather than on us. This attitude of worship to God extends beyond our Sunday services into everything we do, both as the church gathered and as the church scattered throughout the week.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Gospel-Driven Discipleship</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>We believe that the gospel &mdash; the good news of Jesus Christ’s life, death, resurrection, and lordship that offers us salvation by grace through faith &mdash; is the transformative means of both bringing non-Christians from death to life in Christ and bringing Christians to maturity and holiness in their walk with Christ.<p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Grace-Filled Mission</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>We are not here for ourselves. South Durham Church is to be a light in the dark places of the world, both in Durham and around the globe, by sharing the message of Christ and displaying the power of His gospel through works of mercy, justice, and service. We reach out with grace and love because of the grace we’ve experienced in Jesus Christ.</p>
	</dd>

<h3>Our Church Covenant</h3>
<p>A church covenant is a list of biblical commitments our members make to one another. Each of these statements comes from the New Testament.</p>
<blockquote><p>Believing that the Spirit of God has brought us to repent of our sins and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and having been baptized upon our profession of faith in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, we do now, relying on His gracious aid, solemnly and joyfully renew our covenant with one another as one body in Christ:</p><p>We will walk together in a manner worthy of the Lord, one body, as commanded in Scripture, affectionately caring for one another, watching over each other, and faithfully encouraging, admonishing, and pleading with one another in obedience to the Spirit.</p><p>We will faithfully assemble together, grow in fellowship with one another, pray for, and serve one another, always working together to sustain the church’s worship, discipline, and doctrines.</p><p>We will endeavor, by loving and consistent discipleship, to present one another and those under our care mature in Christ before God.</p><p>We will rejoice at each other’s happiness and bear each other’s burdens and sorrows with tenderness and sympathy.</p><p>We will strive for the unity of this church, being slow to anger, slow to speak, and quick to listen, slow to take offense, and quick to reconcile and forgive as instructed by our Lord.</p><p>We will pursue spiritual growth through regular Bible reading and prayer, ever reminding ourselves of the saving grace of God and our assurance of being his adopted children.</p><p>We will seek, by the Holy Spirit’s aid, to live carefully in the world, denying all ungodliness and worldly lusts. We will strive to walk in the good works prepared beforehand by God for us, thereby glorifying God, imitating Christ, and pleasing the Holy Spirit.</p><p>We will labor for the salvation of the lost, praying for them, building relationships with them, and sharing the gospel with them at each opportunity, hoping always in the wisdom, love, and power of God.</p><p>We will welcome, test by the Scriptures, and submit ourselves to the instruction of the elders and teachers, even as we lift up our leaders in prayer before the Lord.</p><p>We will devote our time and abilities for the good of the church, and we will contribute cheerfully, regularly, and sacrificially to the support of the ministry, the expenses of the church, the relief of the poor, and the spread of the gospel through all nations.</p><p>We will, when we move from this place, notify this congregation and covenant with another church faithful to the principles of God’s Word.</p></blockquote>
